# Introduction
The E Compiler X (ECX) project was born in 2002 to replace and improve on the 
AmigaE language and compiler (EC) created by Wouter van Oortmerssen that was 
discontiniued in 1998. ECX is written from scratch in E and compiles itself. 
It is fast, stable, resource efficient, highly compatible, generates quite 
okayish code (for multiple targets) and adds a considerable amount of 
(actually useful) new features and improvements `:)`

Highlights:

1. PowerPC support.
   This is the most important one, and the reason ECX exists.
2. Heavily improved librarymode.
   Probably the easiest and most powerful library mode/support in
   ANY compiler for Amiga/MorphOS EVER .. :)
3. Heavily improved floating point support.
   No more slow and 32bit only..
4. 64bit integer support (PowerPC only)
5. And a lot more..
