# Preprocessor details
All comments are removed before preprocessor is invoked.

It is not possible to redefine built-in language indentifiers like keywords, internal functions, etc.

Directives can start anywhere on a line. There may be horizontal whitespace between the # character and the directive name, like
`#  ifdef ...`.
