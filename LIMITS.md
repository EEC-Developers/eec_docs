## Hardcoded limits:

Maximum values:

- globals
   numberÂ of global variables in application (private+public)
    4000..8000 total size of global data \*
- immediate

   * max length of one immediate string: 16000
   * total length of one continued immediate string ("+"): 16000
   * number of list entries / total list size \*
- arrays
   * number of elements in one array: 32767 (checked)
   * total size of one local array: <32k  (checked)
   * total elements of one global array: 32767 (checked)
   * total size of one array inside object: <32k (checked)
- procedures / methods
   * number of arguments: 255
   * number of local variables / procedure: 4000..8000
   * size of procedure local data: 32k (checked)
   *size of procedure code: min 32k (checked)

   *total length of a continued ("+", ",", "(", etc)) line *
   * codesize of one module 16M
   * codesize of executable 32M

\* : No real limit (to my knowledge `:-)`).
   Available memory will most likely be the ultimate limit.
